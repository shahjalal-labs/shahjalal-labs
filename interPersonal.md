### **1. Tell me about yourself.**

I'm Md. Shahjalal, a MERN Stack Developer passionate about building scalable, maintainable, and human-centered web applications. I thrive in Linux-first, terminal-driven workflows, and specialize in React, Tailwind, Node.js, and MongoDB. My projects reflect a commitment to open-source principles, clean architecture, and user experience. Whether it's building a tourism platform or a smart job portal, I always focus on impact, performance, and innovation.

---

### **2. Why should we hire you? / Why are you suitable for the post?**

You should hire me because I bring a unique blend of technical depth and system-level thinking. I don't just code‚ÄîI architect solutions that scale. With proven experience in building full-stack apps like DeshGuide and FlavorBook, I understand how to ship real products, fast. I‚Äôm highly autonomous, terminal-proficient, and align well with modern, product-focused engineering teams.

---

### **3. How do you stay motivated and engaged in your work over the long term?**

I stay motivated by building things that matter. I love solving real problems with efficient, beautiful systems. Also, using a custom Linux workflow keeps my environment minimal and distraction-free, allowing me to focus deeply. The satisfaction of automating tasks, shipping features, or learning a new tool keeps me consistently engaged.

---

### **4. Tell me about your three weak points.**

- I can get too deep into optimization early‚Äîsometimes at the cost of MVP speed.
- I prefer working independently and sometimes delay asking for help.
- I‚Äôm not very active on social platforms, which limits networking opportunities.

I‚Äôm actively working on each of these areas by collaborating more, prioritizing features better, and engaging in developer communities.

---

### **5. What is your biggest strength?**

My biggest strength is **engineering efficiency**‚ÄîI build fast, clean, and scalable systems using automation, CLI tools, and modern dev practices. My customized development environment is built for productivity and deep work.

---

### **6. What is the skill that makes you different from others?**

My ability to engineer and operate in a **fully terminal-based, highly automated Linux environment** sets me apart. I use tools like Neovim, Tmux, Zsh, Hyprland, and SurfingKeys to write, debug, and manage projects faster than most.

---

### **7. What was your biggest mistake in your life?**

One of my biggest mistakes was initially ignoring soft skills like communication and documentation early in my dev journey. I focused heavily on code but overlooked collaboration. Realizing this, I‚Äôve since made strong efforts to communicate clearly, document well, and contribute meaningfully in team settings.

---

### **8. What types of projects or technologies are you most excited to work on in the future?**

I‚Äôm excited to work on **developer tools**, **automation platforms**, or **performance-heavy apps** where architecture and efficiency matter. I‚Äôm also interested in contributing to open-source tools and building platforms that empower users‚Äîespecially in education, travel, and productivity.

---

### **9. How do you handle situations where you encounter a problem for which you don't immediately have a solution?**

I break the problem into smaller parts and analyze what I do understand. I rely on solid debugging techniques, community forums like Stack Overflow, and documentation. If needed, I reach out to teammates for perspective. I view every such issue as a chance to grow.

---

### **10. Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?**

In five years, I see myself as a senior or lead developer in a forward-thinking company or working independently on impactful open-source projects. I hope to mentor junior devs, architect scalable systems, and contribute to the open web in meaningful ways.

---

### **11. How do you ensure the quality of your work?**

I follow modular architecture, write clean and readable code, and test frequently. I also use tools like Prettier, ESLint, Git for version control, and maintain good documentation. Code reviews and async feedback loops also help refine the product.

---

### **12. How do you handle criticism or feedback?**

I see feedback as a tool for improvement, not personal judgment. I always try to listen objectively, ask clarifying questions, and reflect on what can be improved. I value constructive criticism because it pushes me to grow faster.

---

### **13. What do you do when you feel overwhelmed at work?**

I take a step back, prioritize tasks, and break them into smaller, actionable items. I often rely on my command-line productivity tools to automate or simplify workflows. A short break or deep work session often clears the clutter.

---

### **14. Can you describe a situation where you failed? What did you learn from it?**

In an early group project, I took on too much myself instead of distributing tasks, which led to burnout and delays. I learned the importance of **collaboration**, **trusting the team**, and **communicating early**. Since then, I‚Äôve been more effective at delegating and managing scope.

üìù Request to Allow Markdown for Doc-Type Assignments

Dear Mentor,

I'd like to kindly request that for doc-type assignments such as: Interpersonal Questions

‚Ä¶we are allowed the flexibility to submit in Markdown format, not just Google Docs.

As developers, Markdown gives long-term benefits:

    Clean syntax and version control with Git/GitHub

    IDE-friendly and reusable across projects

    Better suited for developer workflows (VSCode, Obsidian, Neovim, etc.)

    Faster formatting using keyboard-based workflows

üìå This isn't a request to remove Docs ‚Äî only to allow Markdown as an optional format for those who prefer it.

Also, for those who already submitted via Docs, it would help if a later Markdown version is allowed (not as a forced redo, just as an alternative format to keep for our dev notes or GitHub portfolio).

Thanks a lot for considering this flexibility üôè
